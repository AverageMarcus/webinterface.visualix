### Contributing
If you would like to make this project better I would appreciate any help. Send me your merge requests!
A few things that are "nice to haves"

- Backbone, this is my first project using backbone and I am sure I could be doing some things better (refactor)
- Addons, Make it work with your favourite addon - I attempted google music but failed even using it via the ui
- Mobile/Tablet App, I would love to reuse a lot of the code as an app, but dont know how
- Video Support, It would be cool to both browse your video library but also play videos via the browser
- In Browser audio playback, this was a feature of xbmcwui and I miss it a bit
- Photo library, I wouldn't use it, but you might!
